abstract = {In modern computing a program is usually distributed among several processes. The
fundamental challenge when developing reliable and secure distributed programs is
to support the cooperation of processes required to execute a common task, even when
some of these processes fail. Failures may range from crashes to adversarial attacks
by malicious processes.Cachin, Guerraoui, and Rodrigues present an introductory description
of fundamental distributed programming abstractions together with algorithms to implement
them in distributed systems, where processes are subject to crashes and malicious
attacks. The authors follow an incremental approach by first introducing basic abstractions
in simple distributed environments, before moving to more sophisticated abstractions
and more challenging environments. Each core chapter is devoted to one topic, covering
reliable broadcast, shared memory, consensus, and extensions of consensus. For every
topic, many exercises and their solutions enhance the understanding This book represents
the second edition of "Introduction to Reliable Distributed Programming". Its scope
has been extended to include security against malicious actions by non-cooperating
processes. This important domain has become widely known under the name "Byzantine
fault-tolerance". }
